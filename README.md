# Data-analysis-and-prediction
This repository contains a collection of projects focused on data analysis and predictive modeling. It showcases a variety of techniques and methodologies applied to real-world datasets.
## [Project 1: Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-analysis-and-prediction/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Prediction)
Breast Cancer Prediction is a classification task aimed at predicting the diagnosis of a breast mass as either malignant or benign. The dataset used for this prediction consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of the breast mass. These features describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
## [Project 2: Diamond price prediction](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-analysis-and-prediction/tree/main/Diamond%20price%20prediction)
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on several physical and qualitative attributes using a machine learning model. The dataset includes various features that impact the value of a diamond, such as carat (weight), cut (quality), color (from J to D), clarity (from I1 to IF), and physical dimensions like length (x), width (y), depth (z), depth percentage, and table width. By analyzing these features, the model will predict the price of the diamond, which ranges from 
18,823.

This project leverages exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to build an accurate predictive model that can estimate diamond prices, providing insights for pricing strategies in the gemstone market.
## [Project 3: Medical charges prediction](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-analysis-and-prediction/tree/main/Medical%20Charges%20Prediction)
Objective: The goal of this project is to predict individual medical expenses based on various patient attributes using the Insurance dataset. The dataset includes 1338 observations and 7 variables, namely age, body mass index (BMI), number of children covered, smoking status, residential region, and the target variable, medical charges.
## [project 4: Salary analysis and prediction](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-analysis-and-prediction/tree/main/Salary%20Analysis%20and%20prediction)
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and predict salary data using a variety of data science techniques. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the salary dataset, build predictive models to estimate salaries, and 
present the findings in a clear and actionable manner. This will help in understanding salary determinants and making informed decisions based on data-driven insights
## [Project 5: Used car cost prediction](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-analysis-and-prediction/tree/main/Used%20car%20cost%20prediction)
IIn this project, the goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars based on various factors like the car manufacturer, model, kilometers driven, fuel type, body style, and more. The dataset contains over 1,000 entries and 19 features related to used cars, sourced from car dealerships.
## [project 6: Warranty claims fraud prediction](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-analysis-and-prediction/tree/main/Warranty%20claims%20fraud%20prediction)
In this project, the goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars based on various factors like the car manufacturer, model, kilometers driven, fuel type, body style, and more. The dataset contains over 1,000 entries and 19 features related to used cars, sourced from car dealerships.
